                <p>Sponsors help draw crowds to tournaments, and more importantly, they help provide tax-deductable product donations needed to offer prizes for raffles, drawwings, and winnings.  Registered sponsors can find and connect with tournaments and organizers.  Organizers will be able to reach out to sponsors to request sponsorship of events.  The Fishing Tournament System will provide access to sponsors of these events so that you can remain as involved in the proceeding of the fishing tournaments as you desire.  You will be able to display information about your company, (such as logos, photos, contact information, etc.).  Sponsors can:</p>
                <li>Pay the necessary fees to sponsor a tournament</li>
                <li>Obtain information about upcoming fishing tournaments in the area</li>
                <li>Obtain information about fishing clubs in the area</li>
                <li>View and tag photos and details about past, present and future tournaments</li>
                <li>Connect and share on social media</li>
